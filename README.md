# Lab3-NLP

## Overview

In this lab, I gained practical experience in applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques using the Sklearn library. The lab was divided into two main parts: Language Modeling / Regression and Language Modeling / Classification.

### Part 1: Language Modeling / Regression

**Preprocessing Pipeline:**
Implemented a comprehensive NLP preprocessing pipeline including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization and stop words removal.

**Data Encoding:**
- Used Word2vec to encode data vectors for modeling.

**Model Training:**
- Trained Support Vector Regression (SVR), Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and Decision Tree models using the encoded data vectors.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluated the models using standard metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), etc.
- Selected the best model based on performance metrics and provided justification.

**Results Interpretation:**
- Interpreted and analyzed the results obtained from the models to draw meaningful conclusions.

### Part 2: Language Modeling / Classification

**Preprocessing Pipeline:**
Established an NLP preprocessing pipeline including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization and stop words removal.

**Data Encoding:**
- Used Word2vec to encode data vectors for modeling.

**Model Training:**
- Trained Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Ada Boosting models using the encoded data vectors.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Evaluated the models using standard classification metrics such as Accuracy, Loss, F1 Score, etc.
- Selected the best model based on comprehensive evaluation metrics and provided reasoning.

**Results Interpretation:**
- Interpreted and discussed the obtained results to derive insights and implications from the models.

## Synthesis

This lab provided hands-on experience in:
- Implementing NLP preprocessing techniques.
- Applying different encoding methods.
- Training and evaluating various regression and classification models.
- Interpreting model results and making informed decisions based on performance metrics.

This practical experience has deepened my understanding of NLP models and their application in real-world scenarios.
